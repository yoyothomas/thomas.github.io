<p class="toptxt">PROFILE OVERVIEW:</p>
	
	<p class="txt">
		Although you're the noted sign of the virgin, this epithet can be widely interpreted. What's common among Virgos: insistence on absolute purity in one area of life. You may be a complete minx in the bedroom but a devout raw-foodist who won't eat a morsel that's been heated above 46 degrees. Your garage may look like storage space for Antiques Roadshow, while your gleaming kitchen floors are pristine enough to serve dinner on the parquet. Bottom line: Your hungry mind must have something to obsess about, some subject to study with the fascination of Einstein exploring relativity. You're the accidental scholar and the eternal student of life, gaining expertise and mastery as a matter of course. Ruled by communicative Mercury, you need an outlet for espousing your ideas, practical wisdom, and political perspectives—social media and the blogosphere were practically invented for you. As an earth sign, you thrive in a structured environment and need to put regular routines in place in order to ground yourself. Your calendar should be treated like a Bible—otherwise, you become stressed-out and scattered. Plan everything, from date nights to fitness to the time you'll break for lunch each day.</p>
<p class="txt">
Since you rule the stomach and abdominal region, digestion-friendly meals and core-based exercises should be incorporated into your master plan. A Pilates "Reformer" would be a worthwhile investment. You're family-oriented by nature and should seek out a partner who is equally devoted to his clan. Having a peaceful home base is essential to your bliss. Decorate with hues found in nature and keep everything eco-friendly, from your allergen-free mattress to your cleaning products. Sustainable architecture and design can be a Virgo fascination. Your maternal instincts are strong: You're a wise and patient parent to children and pets alike. Having someone to love helps funnel your neurotic streak in a productive direction. Just beware of a tendency to smother loved ones with too much nurturing or to get trapped in a codependent dynamic.

<p class="toptxt">COMPATIBILITY:</p>
<p class="compatibility">VIRGO + TAURUS (APRIL 20 - MAY 20) ♥♥♥♥</p>
<p class="txt">
	You're a pair of sophisticated Earth signs who blend like cashmere and wool. Taurus adds the touch of luxe and Virgo is the solid standby. You're what could be described as a "lovely couple," with good taste, social graces and old-fashioned values. Although your earthy natures can also make you hippies at heart, you tend toward the traditional, and you both like possessions of quality. You'll set up a lovely, well-appointed home—though Taurus will have to fight neat-freak Virgo to keep the plastic slipcovers off the sofas and doilies off the appliances. Virgo is ruled by intellectual Mercury, and Taurus by pleasure-loving Venus. As a result, Taurus is more feisty, raw and direct, which can offend Virgo's stuffed-shirt sensibilities. However, the Virgin soon looses up and learns to laugh at himself. It's good to have sensible Virgo around to pull the brake when Taurus overspends, heads up to the buffet for a fourth helping or tips his glass for a refill. Responsible Virgo has far more self-control than the Bull. In private, you're both sensual and erotic, and you can spend hours wrapped contentedly in your Egyptian cotton sheets. You share a judgmental streak, and if you're too intent on fancying yourselves superior to the world, you may limit your horizons. Open your minds, and be willing to try something "lowbrow" or off your beaten paths. It keeps life interesting.</p>

<p class="compatibility">VIRGO + CANCER (JUNE 21 - JULY 22) ♥♥♥♥</p>
<p class="txt">
	This is a couple that can outlast the ages, since you're fast friends and seamless companions. Virgo is the zodiac's helper and Cancer is its nurturer. Your emotional connection is instant, and you're thrilled to meet a kindred soul who knows how to give, not just take. It's a refreshing break from the usual energy vampires you both attract! Your relationship is sweet and storybook-innocent: lots of handholding, sentimental cards, and anniversary baubles. Yet, you're practical, too, stowing away college funds for your yet-to-be-born children, earning advanced degrees, taking out a mortgage. Security is something you both cherish. In a way, you're like parents and partners to one another: you both express love by nagging, fussing and feeding. And it works. A pair of self-professed nerds, you love to cook, decorate, read novels and learn. No matter how much money you earn, you both remain thrifty, too. (Scoring a high-end treasure at a tag sale or an eBay auction is orgasmic.) Your signs are both family oriented, and you make sweet but strict parents who live for your children. Generally, you're close to your own relatives, and you enjoy spending time at family events or hosting holiday gatherings. Keeping the sexy charge alive will take a little effort, though, since you both love to stay home rather than dress up or hit the town. Push yourselves to leave the nest, and socialize with other couples more often.</p>
