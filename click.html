<p class="toptxt">PROFILE OVERVIEW:</p>
	
	<p class="txt">
		Fly that freak flag high, Aquarius. You may look like an all-American girl on the surface (or not), but behind that distressed-denim jacket beats the heart of a true bohemian. You have the unique ability to combine logic and creativity into pure genius. Few people understand your vision when you simply talk about it. Get into action. Once a tangible product has been brought forth, you catapult to the heights of popularity and respect, like barrier-smashing talk-show queens Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. You have an innate concern for human rights—especially when it comes to fighting for the underdog. Find an appropriate outlet for your inner revolutionary, the more public the better. As an air sign, you're a gifted communicator who is capable of reaching the masses with your message. Like Aquarius author Alice Walker and comedian Chris Rock, your world vision can be funneled through moving works of fiction or politically charged comedy. Few people can match you when it comes to humor, which also makes you popular with a broad spectrum of people. As the sign that rules groups, you thrive in a collaborative environment, managing your teammates with the motivation of a cheerleading captain.</p>
<p class="txt">
Romantically, you could use a little more oomph. Since you generally eschew all things sappy, you may deprive yourself of the lovey-dovey emotions that go along with relationships. A partner who is in tune with the emotional realm would be ideal for you, even if he feels a bit like an alien from time to time. Work on cultivating a clear connection to your own wild streak. Otherwise your connections could fall flat; or your feelings may explode in sudden bursts of anger. You're more comfortable raging than you are crying—you'll need a release for those pent-up emotional lightning strikes. Your sign rules the calves and ankles, so activities like running and biking could become marathon-level obsessions for you. Team sports are also a happy fit for your sign's needs. Scout out the local kickball league or roller derby club and pile on the bonus cool points—not like you really need them.

Ruler: Uranus, the planet of innovation, revolution, and surprises

<p class="toptxt">COMPATIBILITY:</p>
<p class="compatibility">AQUARIUS + ARIES (MARCH 21 - APRIL 19) ♥♥♥♥</p>
<p class="txt">
	You're laugh-a-minute friends who make a fine comedic duo, but the romance isn't as hearty as your side-splitting guffaws. You're amazed by how quickly the other delivers a hilarious comeback or a clever opinion, and it turns you on. Banter leads you to the bedroom fast, where the sex is playful and experimental (though not heavy on the emotional connection). It's as though you've met your twin; and alas, you may soon feel more like siblings than lovers. After a couple weeks, the Bickersons sideshow routine gets old, especially for Aries, and you run out of things to talk about. While casual Aquarius likes to keep the conversation light, Aries has intense, brooding spells that demand way too much emotional attention. For Aquarius, problems are solved with steely logic or left alone, but Aries is unable to curb obsessive thinking, which drives Aquarius mad. Your styles of affection are different, too. Cool Aquarius gets overwhelmed by the Ram's passion and physicality—there's way too much touching, grabbing and kissing for the airy Aquarian temperament. If you're determined to be together, push yourselves to go beyond platonic borders by traveling, taking classes, even performing on stage together. Closeness breeds more ennui than affection. Cultivate mystery through time apart. Your independent signs need to develop your own lives, then reunite with thrilling tales from the road.</p>

<p class="compatibility">AQUARIUS + GEMINI (MAY 21 - JUNE 20) ♥♥♥♥</p>
<p class="txt">
	This match of compatible Air signs can feel a bit like high school romance—teasing, texting, movie dates with jumbo popcorn and licentious groping during the previews. You bring out each other's breezy, buoyant spirits, and that's a plus. You'll bond over TV shows, favorite sci-fi novels and superheroes, obscure philosophers, music. With your clever comebacks and verbal repartee, you could take a comedy act on the road. Although you can both be overly cerebral at times, you prefer laughter and light conversation to emotional melodrama. Eventually, though, you need to get out of the shallow end of the pool. Intimacy is a challenge for your signs. We're talking true intimacy—being caught with your pants down and no clue how to get them back up. Telling each other your entire life stories in monologue form (which could have happened on the first date) doesn't count. You must soldier through the post-infatuation "awkward phase," or you'll end up feeling like buddies. That would be a shame, as you can make excellent life partners and playmates. The biggie: you'll both need to give up fibs and lies—particularly lies of omission. You're excellent storytellers and politicos, gifted at crafting a spin to fit your agenda. However, the naked truth is the only way out of the Matrix. Though it may topple your PR-friendly public image, it's a necessary risk you must take to build the character and depth of a lasting commitment.</p>
